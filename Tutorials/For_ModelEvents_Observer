Model Event is use when any event fire that mean if we insert any user in table 
then create event will fired so that time model event fire autometically

USE : - if any user register then admin will get email automatically by useing model event


# Types of events: - 

# Creating :== before recoard  has been created
# Created :== after recoard has been created

# saving : = before recoard has been saved
# saved : = after recoard has been saved

# updating:== before recoard has been updated
# updated :== after recoard has been updated

# deleting:== before recoard has been deleted
# deleted :== after recoard has been deleted


example : -  we have 2 tables one is user table and another is post table.
             user table have user data and post table have multiple posts which created by user.
             so when i delete user from user table then 
             all posts of the same user will also delete from posts table AUTOMETICALLY



STEP 1 : - #create resource controller users and posts like this   

            php:artisan make:controller UserController --resource
            php:artisan make:controller PostController  --resource

            # route: = 

            Route::resource('user',UserController::class)
            Route::resource('post',PostController::class)

             # controller
            
             namespace App\Http\Controllers;
             use Illuminate\Http\Request;
             use App\Models\User
 
             class UserController extends Controller
             {
               
                public function index()
                {
                   $userData = User::with('post')->find(1);
                   return $userData;
                }
             }


#******************************************************************************************
STEP 2 : - #create model users and posts like this 
             
               php:artisan make:model User
               php:artisan make:model Post
           
            # and join the user model to post model like this 

            # model 
            namespace App\Models;

            use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
            use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

            class users extends Model
            {
               use HasFactory;

               public function post(){
                  return $this->hasMany(Post::class) # $this means user Tabel and Post mean post table
               }
            }

#******************************************************************************************
STEP 3 : -  #  When i want to delete any user data with his post also then 
            #  protected static function booted() called autometically
            #  when data deleted from user table (it find deleted event and call autometic) 


            # controller
            
            namespace App\Http\Controllers;
            use Illuminate\Http\Request;
            use App\Models\User

            class UserController extends Controller
            {
              
               public function create()
               {
                  $userData = User::find(1)->delete(); #id1 user data deleted from user table
                  
               }
            }

             # model 
             namespace App\Models;

             use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
             use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
 
             class users extends Model
             {
                use HasFactory;
 
               #  public function post(){
               #     return $this->hasMany(Post::class) # $this means user Tabel and Post mean post table
               #  }

                protected static function booted():void{
                  static:deleted(function($userFlag){ # deleted is event
                     $userFlag->post()->delete();
                  })
                }
             }
